#Suggestions for Performers

Given the limited amount of scholarship on performance practice relevant to this
repertoire, this section is necessarily speculative and should be taken as a
spur to creativity, and hopefully a challenge to further research---in
particular, research \emph{through} performance.

The first thing to bear in mind is that the sources for these editions are
performing parts that were used repeatedly by performers to meet local needs,
and within the constraints of local material resources, personnel, and in most
cases limited rehearsal time.
Whatever may seem to be unclear or inconsistent in the parts was not a hindrance
to performance for their seventeenth-century performers.


Continuo parts may have been performed as follows:
\term{bajón} or a bowed string instrument playing the bass line
small organ, Spanish harp, \term{vihuela de mano} playing the bass line plus
improvised harmonies above according to the figures, convention, and ear


If an ensemble today has access to Spanish \term{bajones}, \term{chirimías},
chromatic cross-strung Spanish harp, portative organ, and an ensemble of
celibate, ordained men and boys or female monastics, and access to a highly
reverberant church building in which the performers are able to face each other
in choirs while any hearers listen from behind a fence or through a wall, then
that ensemble can be assured of a reasonably authentic performance situation.




#Realizing continuo



In parts with a continuo accompaniment (those pieces with a part labeled
\mentioned{Acompañamiento}, \mentioned{General}, \mentioned{Guión}), the written
notes were most likely played by a combination of instruments;
th


#Voicing 

All-male chorus with boys, adolescents, and/or falsettists on the high voices
or 
All-female chorus

Mixed chorus

Chorus I in polychoral textures may have been soloists or a reduced ensemble or
more highly skilled singers

Coplas in many pieces were likely sung by soloists or a reduced ensemble

#Pitch Level

As written but with \pitch{A}{4} tuned significantly lower than 440Hz, possibly
as much as a minor third lower in some places
and/or
Transposed down as needed, with instrumentalists adapting by ear or with
imagined changes of clef or transposing instruments (e.g, transpose down a
fourth by subtracting a flat from key signature of one flat)

As written, as written but with \pitch{A}{4} tuned lower
or
Transposed down (contact the editor for a transposed edition)


#Instrumentation

**
Continuo parts (labeled \mentioned{Acompañamiento}, \mentioned{General},
\mentioned{Guión}):
\term{Bajón} and/or bowed string playing (e.g., \term{vihuela de arco}) on bass line
plus combination of small organ, (cross-strung chromatic) harp, plucked string
like \term{vihuela de mano} playing bass line plus improvised harmonies
according to the figures, convention, and ear

Any keyboard instrument, but preferably an organ or keyboard with high-quality
organ samples (see GrandOrgue), using just 8$'$ flue stops (possibly also 4$'$)
Plus, if available:
Any combination of bassoon, violoncello, harp, Classical guitar, lute

**
Instrumental bass lines (labeled \mentioned{Bajo [inst.]}):
\term{Bajón}, possibly also bowed string instrument

Bassoon, violoncello, keyboard left hand

**
Other voices doubled *colla parte*:
Depending on venue, festivity, and available resources,
upper voices likely doubled by \term{bajón}, \term{bajoncillo},
\term{chirimía}, \term{sacabuche}, and/or possibly bowed strings
(\term{vihuelas}), other winds

Any combination of bassoons, oboes, trombones; and/or strings, other winds to
taste and according to local resources

**
Use fewer instruments to double fewer voices (e.g., solo coplas could just be
voice, keyboard, and bass instrument, while estribillo could be the full
ensemble of chorus with reeds, etc.)

#Pronunciation

Have a native speaker or someone who has spent significant time in
Spanish-speaking communities guide your pronunciation so that it is intelligible
to Spanish speakers in your audience

General guide to Spanish pronunciation
Vowels equivalent to Italian, pure, no glides
a
father
e
make or metal
i
feet 
o 
poke
u
hoot
silent in "gue" "que"

Consonants with different sounds than English
b
like English 'butter' but softer
ca-, co-, cu-
not exploded (like "bacon", not "copper")
ce-, ci-
Latin American: English S sound like "said", "see"
Mainland Spanish: English unvoiced TH sound like "theft", "thick"
d
unaccented, between vowels: generally like the "th" in father (unvoiced)
beginning of word, accented: not exploded, like "pedal" more than "diet"
f 
same as English
ge-, gi-
aspirated English H, like "aha!" or German "Ich"
ga-, go-, gue
hard English g, like "got", "go", "get" (u is silent in "gue")
h
silent, not pronounced at all 
j
strongly aspirated English H, like German "Ach" or Scottich "loch" (if
necessary, plain H as in "aha" will be understood)
l
like Italian, with the tongue touching the palate rather than the teeth
ll
like an emphatic English Y as in "yikes"; in some regions this can start to sound more like
"zh" as in "azure" or even J as in "judge"
m, n
like English but a bit clearer
p 
not exploded (like "flipping", not "pop")
q
like English K but not exploded 
r, between vowels, end of word
flipped or rolled, never swallowed rhotic R like USA "red" or vowel sound like
British "baker"; 
 flipped R rather like the D in "meadow";  like the D in "leader" and not the R
(beginners might actually say a D sound if they cannot yet flip the R)
rr, r at beginning of word
rolled/trilled R (singers who cannot roll the R should use a flipped R or
English soft D sound liked "meadow")
t
not exploded (like casual "fitting", not "tight")
v
like English b as in "boy", but a bit softer; never like "violet"
x
in modern spelling, like English x ("axle") or Z ("xenophobia")
in seventeenth-century Spelling, equivalent to J (and thus J is used in this
edition, e.g., "Baxo" is rendered as "Bajo")
y
like Spanish i
z
Latin American: like Spanish S
Mainland Spanish: like mainland Spanish ce-, ci-; that is, unvoiced English TH
sound like "thick"


Historic:
The local pronunciation of Spanish according to norms of the lettered elite:
In Spanish America, ce-, ci-, and z- pronounced with English S sound 
In Madrid, Castile, and most of Aragón, pronounced with English TH sound
In Catalunya, probably pronounced with English S sound

The S sound in this case is confirmed by orthographic variants in manuscripts
from Puebla and Catalunya (e.g., consonancias spelled consonansias)

Spelling variants in the Cererols manuscripts make clear that the copyist
pronounced Spanish with a Catalan accent (e.g., "Suspended" is written
"Suspendet" as it would be pronounced in Catalan)

The poetic texts of villancicos circulated all over the globe and were set to
music many times by composers across the Empire.
The poem "Suspended, cielos, vuestro dulce canto" may have been performed like
so:

in Madrid for its first known performance, with Madrid TH sound for soft C: 
Sus - pen -deð, Ðielos, buestro dulÐe canto
in Montserrat in the surviving setting by Cererols, with Catalan accent:
Sus - pen -det, sielos, buestro dulse canto
in Seville in lost setting by Miguel Mateo de Dallo y Lana, or in Puebla after
Dallo y Lana emigrated there:
Sus - pen -deð, sielos, buestro dulse canto

The important thing in every case is that people who spoke Spanish natively,
pronounced the text in the way they understood it so as to be understood by
their hearers.
In a modern context, I do not see any reason to try to use multiple varieties of
Spanish pronunciation in one program.
For example, *Qué música divina* is a poem written in the Zaragoza region and
set to music by a composer from the same area (consonanÐias); but the only surviving setting
exists in a convent collection in Puebla and reflects local pronunciation
(consonansias);
the piece may well be arranged or adapted for women's ensemble from an original
for men's ensemble.

If a modern performance is to be an informed recreation of historic practice,
does it recreate the piece as a piece from Puebla or Zaragoza?

I suggest once again that the best thing is to consult with a native speaker to
make the Spanish texts comprehensible to Spanish-speaking listeners, especially
in communities like almost every city in the United States in which people of
Latino heritage and culture form an indispensable and growing core of the
population
