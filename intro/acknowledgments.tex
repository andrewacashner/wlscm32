\section*{Acknowledgments}

This edition was produced with free and open-source software on the Debian 
GNU/Linux operating system, release 8.
The text was typeset with the \LaTeX{} document-preparation system, based on 
the work of Donald Knuth and Leslie Lamport.
The music was typeset with Lilypond, version 2.19.
I am grateful to the hundreds of volunteers who build and maintain these 
systems, and to those who provided specific help in programming this document.

The text typeface is EB Garamond, designed by Georg Duffner, based on 1592 type 
specimens by Claude Garamont.
The Spanish CZ metrical symbol used in the scores was traced manually in 
Inkscape from a villancico manuscript by Miguel de Irízar.
