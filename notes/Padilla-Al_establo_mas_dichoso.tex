This piece is part of Padilla's cycle of villancicos for Christmas 1652 at 
Puebla Cathedral, copied as a set into individual partbooks, possibly in 
Padilla's own hand.%
    \Autocites{Cashner:PadillaRhythm-AMS}[406--462]{Cashner:PhD}
This is the earliest of this composer's extant Christmas cycles for which all 
the partbooks survive.

The partbooks bear the names of some of the Puebla chapel performers in various 
places.
The name of Francisco Rodríguez is in the Tiple I part, and that of Sr. Nicolás 
Griñón is in the Tenor II.

The Puebla cathedral chapel was usually organized in two choirs, but since this 
piece does not utilize polychoral textures, the edition presents the voices in 
a single-choir layout.

This musical \quoted{salad} features multiple sections with contrasting styles
with the names of songs or dances, which were likely based on specific music or
types of music already known to the audience.
Because of these multiple sections and large amount of repetition within 
sections, the parts are written in an abbreviated manner.
This edition writes out most of the reprises and other repeated material to 
achieve a more straightforward presentation for performers.
Examples of this include the stanzas of the \term{Nuevo Troyano} and the 
\term{responsión} reprise of the \term{Papalotillo}.

The piece has been recorded once prior to this edition.%

\notesection{Bass Parts}

Both bass parts are intended for instrumental performance.
They have only incipits of the lyrical text to help orient the player.
The Bassus I part contains this marking after the \term{Nuevo Troyano} and 
before the \term{Papalotillo}: \quotedgloss{antes del papalotillo diçe el 
harriero con el otro bajon}{Before the \term{papalotillo} the mule skinner 
\quoted{speaks} with the other \term{bajón}}.
This implies that both bass parts were played on the \term{bajón}, not to 
exclude other continuo instruments like harp.
The sections labeled \term{Dúo} (the \term{Arriero} and the beginning of the 
\term{Negrilla}) are actually, in modern terms, vocal solos with accompaniment, 
perhaps intended for a single vocalist with solo \term{bajón}.

If a vocal solo with \term{bajón} is a \term{Dúo}, then the section marked 
\term{Papalotillo Solo} would seem to be a true solo without any accompaniment 
at all.
The scribe has only written a four-bar accompaniment pattern in the bass, with 
unspecific indications to repeat.
This edition therefore includes the bass line for the \term{Papalotillo} only 
for the \term{responsión}.
But it is also plausible that the bass should repeat the same phrase as 
accompaniment for the coplas.

\notesection{The \soCalled{Gloria}}

In the midst of the \term{Negrilla}, which caricatures people of African
descent, an \soCalled{Angolan} character (T.~II) sings, \quoted{Listen, for we
are singing like the angels}.
Then the two upper voices of the first chorus (Tiple and Altus I) sing the 
angels' song from Luke~2 in Spanish, \quoted{Gloria en las alturas y en la 
tierra, paz}, continuing in the ternary meter of the preceding section.
This section is labeled \quoted{A 3} in the Tiple I part.

The Tiple II and Altus II parts contain only one phrase of notated music for 
the \term{ensaladilla}.
Both are labeled \quoted{A 3 de la ensaladilla}, and contain music for the 
Spanish \quoted{Gloria}, but in C meter instead of the CZ meter of the other 
voices.
The Tiple II melody quotes a common plainchant intonation of 
the \worktitle{Gloria in excelsis} of the Mass.

The Tiple II part actually includes an earlier version in CZ that has been 
crossed out and replaced with one in C.
The only way to align these voices with those of Chorus I is to maintain the 
theoretical $3:2$ proportion of minims between CZ and C meter so that the 
perfect semibreve in CZ is equal in time to the semibreve in C.

The reason for the marking \quoted{A 3}, when there is notated music for four 
voices, is unclear.
Given the crossed-out and corrected music in the Tiple II, it is also possible 
that \quoted{A 3} functions primarily as a rehearsal marking, and that Padilla 
changed his mind about the scoring after writing out the Chorus I parts, but 
left the marking intact.
