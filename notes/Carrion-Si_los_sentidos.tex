Carrión, who succeeded Miguel de Irízar as chapelmaster of Segovia Cathedral after Irízar's death in 1684, sets a version of the same villancico poem as Irízar's \worktitle{Si los sentidos}.
Carrión's text corresponds more closely to the version attributed to Vicente Sánchez in 1688.
He follows Sánchez's ordering of the coplas but does not include two of Sánchez's coplas.

Like Irízar, Carrión apparently expects the soloist to adapt the rhythm of the coplas to fit the poetry of the subsequent stanzas.

As in many later seventeenth-century villancicos, there is no sign indicating that the estribillo should be repeated, as was customary with earlier villancicos.
The recurring tag line at the end of each copla may have been made it unnecessary to repeat the whole estribillo.

The suggested tempo relationship between the music in (C)Z meter and the music in C is only approximate. 
As with other Spanish villancicos from the later seventeenth century, the music in C seems to call for a slower tempo, with a feel closer to modern \meter{4}{4}.
