This critical edition is based on two manuscript sources of this villancico, \term{CAN} and \term{Bbc}, the latter previously unknown.
It replaces the earlier edition by David Pujols, which was based on \term{CAN} only and included some errors.
Most critically, \term{MEM} mistakenly omits the breve rest in this edition's measure 39, thus shifting the Alto fugue entrance one bar earlier through \measure{47}.
This edition is not only based on an additional manuscript source but also improves on the earlier Montserrat edition by indicating editorial additions and mensural coloration, correcting lyrical underlay, and including the manuscript's figured bass.

The two manuscript sources present minor variants of the same piece of music.
Both sources are probably copies based with some degree of separation on an original exemplar by Cererols at the Abbey of Montserrat, where he was monk and chapelmaster until his death in 1680.%
  \autocite{Bonastre:CererolsSymposium}
The original was most likely been lost when the abbey library burned in the nineteenth century.

Only \term{CAN} includes all the voice parts and the coplas, and thus it is the primary source for this edition.%
  \autocite[60--61]{Bonastre:CanetCatalog}
In comparing the parts that survive in both versions, there are only a few significant differences in \term{Bbc}: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item One phrase of lyrics is changed to make the piece fit a Eucharistic dedication.
The lyrics of \term{CAN} make more sense as a Christmas piece, despite the dedication to the Blessed Sacrament on the cover leaf of the group of partbooks.
\item The highest voice part has a different final phrase in the estribillo.
\item \term{Bbc} includes the dynamic markings \term{eco} and \term{falsete}.
\item \term{Bbc} differs in the usage of accidentals on C, F, and B; in most cases it is more explicit, writing out accidentals in situations where \term{musica ficta} practice would suggest them anyway.
\end{enumerate}
This edition follows \term{CAN}, but does include the dynamic markings from \term{Bbc} in parentheses.
The placement of accidentals on the staff, as opposed to advisory accidentals above it, follows \term{CAN} as well, but it should be noted that many of the advisory accidentals are written out explicitly in \term{Bbc}.


\notesection{Related Sources}

This villancico is the only complete musical setting yet found of one of the most popular villancico poems of the seventeenth century.
The poem as set by Cererols is one variant of a textual tradition extending back as early as a Royal Chapel performance in 1651.
A distinct branch of later variant versions may be traced to the work of Manuel de León Marchante from 1675.

This family of villancico poems is attested in the following imprints:

\begin{tabular}{lll}
  1651 & Madrid & \signature{E-Mn}{R/34199/27}\\
  1668 & Calatayud & \signature{GB-Lbl}{11450.dd.8~(54)}\\
  1675 & Alcalá & Reprinted in Marchante, \worktitle{Obras poéticas} (Madrid, 1733), 139\\
  1680 & Seville & \signature{E-Mn}{VE/83/10}\\
  1681 & Seville & \signature{E-Mn}{VE/79/7}\\
  1683 & Zaragoza & \signature{E-Mn}{VE/129/2}, \signature{GB-Lbl}{1073.k.22~(07)}\\
  1689 & Madrid & \signature{E-Mn}{VE/88/80}\\
\end{tabular}

Cererols's text incorporates aspects of both the early Royal Chapel tradition and the versions influenced by Marchante.
In a few passages, the text of the coplas in the Canet manuscript departs from the consensus of the other poetic imprints from this villancico tradition.
This edition preserves the text in \term{CAN}, but corrects a few phrases in which the consensus reading of the other imprints makes more sense both poetically and grammatically.
