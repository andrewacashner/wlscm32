\noteshead{Miguel de Irízar, \worktitle{Si los sentidos queja forman del Pan Divino}}

\notesource{E-SE:~5/32, Manuscript performing parts (Tiple 1, Tiple 2, Alto, and Tenor of Chorus I; Tiple, Alto, Tenor, and Bajo of Chorus II; \foreign{Acompañamiento})}

The Bajo II part has no text underlay and would have been played on \term{bajón}.

The lyrics correspond closely with those attributed to Vicente Sánchez in the \worktitle{Lira Poetica} (Zaragoza, 1689), 171--172.
Irízar died in 1684, so he either had access to an earlier version of Sánchez's text through his correspondence network, or Sánchez's text is an improvement on a pre-existing poem that Irízar used.
Irízar uses a different selection and ordering of coplas than Sánchez.
