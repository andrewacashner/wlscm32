# Transcribing accidentals in seventeenth-century villancicos

Andrew Cashner, Feb. 6, 2017

All of the pieces in this edition survive in manuscript performing parts, one
sheet or booklet to each part.

In the performing parts, the music is notated in mensural notation.
In these sources, barlines are only added occasionally to show sectional
divisions or to clarify confusing passages (the latter cases are usually in a
different hand and were likely  added later by a performer).[^Irizar]

[^Irizar]:
For Irízar's *Si los sentidos* only, there is also the composer's draft in score
format.
Irízar does use barlines regularly in his scores, generally fitting two basic
metrical groups (*compases* in Spanish) between each set of barlines.


Copyists placed sharp or flat signs only to specify accidentals where performers
might not otherwise sing them according to *musica ficta* conventions.
These placement of these accidentals is not consistent and can be ambiguous.
In many cases, accidentals are placed with regard to the *compás* or metrical
unit (two minims in C time, three minims in C3 time).

There was no natural sign, so in some cases copyists used sharps as "cautionary
accidentals" to cancel out *ficta* rules.
For example, a singer would likely interpret the passage D--E--D as a case of
*una nota super la semper est canendum fa*, and sing D--Eb--D; so the copyist
writes D--E#--D to specify that the E is natural.
A more complicated case: in a passage notated G--F#--G, the second note aligns
with a clear F natural in another voice part, and so the F# is interpreted as a
cautionary accidental that actually tells the singer *not* to sharp the F per
*ficta* convention, but to sing F natural instead.





## Proposed policy for accidentals

- Accidentals are placed according to modern conventions, in order to produce
  the same sounds specified by the manuscripts (which are partbooks in mensural
  notation without barlines)
- This means an accidental in the edition affects the line it is placed on until
  the end of the current bar and is cancelled at the beginning of the next
  (except for tied notes, where the accidental carries over)
- Accidentals written on the staff are those specified explicitly in the
  manuscript
- Accidentals written on the staff in parentheses are not specified explicitly
  in the manuscript but the editor has no doubt about them.
    * In some cases, these are the result of applying *musica ficta* rules like
      *una nota super la semper est canendum fa*
    * In other cases, it is possible to compare an uncertain passage against
      related passages---such as unison figures with other voices,
      cross-relations, and repetitions of musical material---where the
      accidental *is* certain in the related passage
    * Parenthetical accidentals could also be used as editorial cautionary
      accidentals: e.g., even though the manuscript has F natural, the editor
      might add a natural in parentheses to clarify a potentially confusing
      passage
- Accidentals written above the staff are suggested by the editor but are not
  certain
    * They cannot be confirmed with certainty by reference to *ficta* rules,
      parallel passages, etc.

## Examples

Bar     Voice   Edition                 Rationale   
----    ------- ----------------        ---------------
1--3    Ti I-1  F sharp on staff        F sharp written explicitly in both MSS     
10      Ti I-2  (C sharp)               MS: C, but C sharp avoids cross-relation 
                                        with Ti. II
23--24  T II    F sharp above           MS: g-f-e-f-g-a-f#; F sharp sounds better,
                                        *ficta* rule?
25      T II    (F natural)             Avoid cross-relation with Ti I-2
                                        entrance
29--30  Ti I-2  Sharp then natural      MS: no accidentals. in m. 29, F sharp against A
                above staff             major sixth leads correctly into perfect
                                        octave G in m. 30, matches intervallic
                                        pattern of imitation in Ti I-1 mm. 30-31; 
                                        in m. 30, F sharp would clash against F
                                        natural in Ti I-1, m. 31 and would
                                        seemingly require a notated sharp
